# Gerald's Python Notes
Notes from my adventures in python :)
------


### Overview:
This repository contains my personal notes and code from
the HackerRank exercises I have completed. It is simply
a personal repository for me to document my experience.
I hope to continuously improve as I do more exercises!


### NB:

I have added comments and notes to my code using the
'Better Comments' extension by Aaron Bond on VSCode
