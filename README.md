# Gerald's Python Notes
Notes from my adventures in python :)
------


### Overview:
This repository contains my personal notes and code from
the HackerRank exercises I have completed. It is simply
a personal repository for me to document my experience.

I have sorted the exercises into their respective subdomains,
which can be viewed from subdomains_picture.png

I hope to continuously improve as I do more exercises!
